>> - The >> command is used to redirect the output of a command to a file and append the output to the end of the file. For example, the command echo "Hello World" >> myfile.txt would append the text "Hello World" to the end of the file myfile.txt.

< - The < command is used to redirect the input of a command from a file. For example, the command sort < myfile.txt would sort the contents of the file myfile.txt.

<< - The << command is used to provide input to a command without having to create a separate file. It is called a "here-document" and allows you to specify multiple lines of input. For example, the command cat << EOF would allow you to enter multiple lines of input and terminate the input by typing EOF on a line by itself.

> - The > command is used to redirect the output of a command to a file and overwrite the contents of the file. For example, the command echo "Hello World" > myfile.txt would write the text "Hello World" to the file myfile.txt and overwrite any existing contents.

| - The | command is used to pipe the output of one command as input to another command. For example, the command ls -l | grep myfile.txt would list the contents of the current directory in long format and then filter the results to show only lines containing the text "myfile.txt".

$ - The $ command is used to expand a shell variable or a command substitution. For example, the command echo $HOME would display the path to the current user's home directory.

# - The # command is used to specify a comment in a shell script. Any text following the # symbol on a line is treated as a comment and ignored by the shell.

& - The & command is used to run a command in the background. For example, the command sleep 60 & would run the sleep command in the background for 60 seconds, allowing you to continue using the shell while the command runs.

&& - The && command is used to run a second command only if the first command is successful. If the first command exits with a status of zero (indicating success), the second command will be executed. If the first command exits with a non-zero status (indicating failure), the second command will not be executed. For example, the command make && make install would run the make command to compile a program, and if the compilation succeeds (exits with a status of zero), the make install command would be executed to install the program.

{} - The curly braces {} are used for brace expansion in Linux. They are used to generate a series of strings based on a pattern. For example, the command mkdir {1..5} will create five directories named 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

[] - The square brackets [] are used to define a range or a set of characters in Linux commands. They are used in commands such as ls and grep to match files or strings that match a specific pattern. For example, the command ls [abc]* will list all files in the current directory that start with the letters a, b, or c.

* - The asterisk * is known as a wildcard character in Linux. It can be used to represent any number of characters in a filename or path. For example, the command ls *.txt will list all files in the current directory that end with the .txt extension.

? - The question mark ? is also a wildcard character in Linux, but it represents a single character. For example, the command ls file?.txt will list all files in the current directory that have a filename consisting of the word file, followed by any single character, and ending with the .txt extension.

( ) - Parentheses. These can be used for several functions:
1.Subshells: In shell scripting, parentheses can be used to create a subshell, which is a new shell environment that runs within the current shell. Any commands or variables defined within the subshell are not visible outside of it. For example, (cd /path/to/dir && ls) will change the current directory to /path/to/dir within the subshell, list the contents of that directory, and then return to the previous directory.
2. Command grouping: Parentheses can also be used to group commands together and execute them as a single unit. This is useful for situations where you want to redirect the output of multiple commands to a single file or pipe them to another command. For example, (command1; command2) > output.txt will execute command1 and command2 in sequence, and redirect their output to a file called output.txt.
3. Command substitution: In some shells, including Bash, parentheses can be used for command substitution. This means that the command within the parentheses is executed and its output is substituted into the current command. For example, echo "Today is $(date +%A)" will insert the name of the current day into the output of the echo command.
